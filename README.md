# Problem Statement:

In todays competition, the author will present you a dataset. This dataset contains a total of 8 attributes and concerns over predicting the fuel consumption of various vehicles rode in cities. Therefore, this is a job of regression with multiple variables. 

The project is about constructing a machine learning model that accurately predicts the fuel consumption from the provided dataset.

# The tools I used for this project are:

*1. Python
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Scipy
6. Scikit-learn
7. Statsmodel*

# Concept and Model:

From the dataset give to us, I have concluded that:

1. Car weight and displacement have the strongest inverse correlation with mileage. Lines up well with intuition that the more weighted cars isnâ€™t the most efficient user of gasoline.

2. Horsepower and number of cylinders are also strongly inversely correlated with mileage meaning a fast car needs more number of cylinders.

3. MPG is also the primary measurement of a car's fuel efficiency.

Keeping these three factors in mind, I have designed a multiple linear regression ML model to make the predictions.

Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.
